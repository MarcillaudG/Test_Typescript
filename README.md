# Node.js with TypeScript

[SUBJECT.md for the instructions](./SUBJECT.md)

## Summary

This was a pleasant experience, not gonna lie a little stressful and tiring. Except the frontend part, this was really interesting.
I hope I did well.

## Comments

I hardly use comments, wrongly used they add noise and make the code less readable. I usually prefer using 
understable names for everything and short functions. However, when I can't shorten a function I add some 
comments. 

## Architecture

I followed the MVC model and use many folders. Some only have one file in it  but it is not a problem

## WARNING
Don't forget to create a .env file with :

- TOKEN_SIZE="SIZE"
    - TOKEN_SIZE="10"
- TOKEN_GITHUB="TOKEN"
- DB_CONN_STRING="mongodb:uri:port
    - DB_CONN_STRING="mongodb://localhost:27017/"
- DB_NAME="Database Name"
- USER_COLLECTION_NAME="users"
